#### Problem:
***Rock, paper, scissor* is a two-player hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes: rock (closed fist), paper (flat hand), or scissors (two fingers extended). The winner is determined by the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.**



## Problem Solving Process:
1. [Understanding](#understanding)
2. [Planning](#planning)
3. [Divide and Conquer](#dividing-problem-in-subform)
4. [Pseudocode](#pseudocode)


### 1. Understanding:
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
- **The Moves:** Each player secretly chooses one of the three moves: rock, paper, or scissors.
- **Simultaneous Reveal:** Both players reveal their chosen move at the same time.
- **The Rules:**
    - Rock vs. Scissors: Rock crushes scissors, so rock wins.
    - Scissors vs. Paper: Scissors cut paper, so scissors wins.
    - Paper vs. Rock: Paper covers rock, so paper wins.
    - Ties: If both players choose the same move, it's a tie, and they play again.
- **Playing the Game:** The game can be played in a best-of-three or best-of-five rounds format, with the player who wins the most rounds declared the winner.

## Planning:
- GUI = NO [Now, No need to implement Graphical User Interface]
- CLI = YES [only work in console]
- First Create Subforms of Big Problem.
- Plan each subform at a time, use Pen and paper write basic idea for start implement in actual code.
- Then write Pseudocode Code With actual code.
- Use Functions and if-else conditional statement
- Solve each subform problem and check output is correct.
- When All Subform problem solve then implement big problem via join subform and check output is correct

## Dividing Problem in Subform:
- [ âœ” ] Write the logic to get the computer choice
- [ âœ” ] Write the logic to get the human choice
- [ âœ” ] Declare the players score variables
- [ âœ” ] Write the logic to play a single round
- [  ] Write the logic to play the entire game

## Pseudocode:
- Make some idea for solve each subform problem, Use pen-paper.
- Write algorithm to step by step solve the problem.
- Pseudocode write in actual code, With the help of comment in code.
